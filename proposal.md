# üè≠ Factory Maintenance Workflow System Proposal

## üìã Executive Summary
This document proposes the development of a hybrid hardware/software system to support scheduled maintenance tasks in a factory setting. The system will aim to assist workers‚Äîsuch as operators and their assistants‚Äîin performing routine operations like cleaning or inspecting machinery, while providing managers with tools to create and track these workflows. The project is still in its planning stage; no hardware or software has been developed yet. A custom task-tracking device is under consideration as a primary interface for workers, alongside alternative options such as smartwatches.

---

## üéØ Objectives
The core goal is to create an efficient and reliable system for:
- Defining and assigning maintenance routines
- Tracking the execution of tasks by workers
- Reporting issues as they occur in the workflow
- Providing real-time oversight and historical logs for managers

---

## üë• Roles and Responsibilities

**Managers** will:
- Define and edit workflow routines per sector
- Assign steps to operators or assistants
- Monitor real-time progress and receive reports

**Operators and Assistants** will:
- View and acknowledge assigned maintenance tasks
- Mark steps as completed
- Report any issues encountered during execution

## üß± System Architecture Overview

The proposed system will include the following core components:

### 1. Task-Tracking Device (Wrist or Handheld)

This component is central to the interaction between the user and the system. Several implementation options are being evaluated:

| Option                      | Description                                      | Display Type     | Controls           | Battery Type      | Connectivity | Est. Unit Cost (USD) |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------|-------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| Custom ESP32 Bracelet      | ESP32 + 2"‚Äì3" TFT screen                         | Resistive TFT    | Physical Buttons   | Li-Ion (18650) or Li-Po 503450 | ESP-NOW / Wi-Fi | $20‚Äì30               |
| Android Smartwatch         | Off-the-shelf Android Wear OS watch             | Capacitive OLED  | Touchscreen        | Internal          | Wi-Fi / BLE  | $50‚Äì200              |
| Rugged Handheld Android    | Budget rugged PDA with Android                  | Capacitive LCD   | Touchscreen + Buttons | Internal       | Wi-Fi / BLE  | $70‚Äì150              |

The final choice will depend on cost, user feedback, and robustness required for the environment. 

### 2. Sector Hub Gateways

- ESP32-based fixed devices
- Deployed per sector
- Receive ESP-NOW messages from task-tracking devices
- Forward data to backend over Wi-Fi (via MQTT or REST API)

### 3. Backend System

- **Language & Framework:** Python with FastAPI
- **Database:** PostgreSQL or SQLite
- **Core Services:**
  - Workflow and task assignment APIs
  - Status tracking and alerts
  - Issue logging
  - Workflow import from Microsoft Project (future phase)

### 4. Web Dashboard

- For use by managers
- Provides visibility into task status, timelines, and reported issues

## üîå Communication and Coverage

| Path              | Protocol | Coverage Estimate | Notes                       |
|-------------------|----------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| Device ‚Üí Hub      | ESP-NOW  | 15‚Äì50m             | Works well in open spaces   |
| Hub ‚Üí Server      | Wi-Fi    | LAN-wide           | Depends on network setup    |

Multiple hubs may be installed per sector to ensure coverage without requiring workers to walk long distances.

## üì¶ Development Roadmap

### Phase 1 ‚Äì Initial Research & Prototyping (1‚Äì2 months)
- Validate coverage and device ergonomics
- Build basic prototype with ESP32 and display
- Implement minimum viable backend and dashboard

### Phase 2 ‚Äì Sector Pilot (2 months)
- Test in one or two sectors
- Evaluate feedback from workers and managers
- Finalize hardware selection

### Phase 3 ‚Äì Full Deployment (3‚Äì4 months)
- Scale device manufacturing
- Integrate MS Project import tool
- Finalize dashboard and add analytics

---

## üí∞ Estimated Costs

### Task-Tracking Device (Custom Hardware)
- Microcontroller (ESP32): $3‚Äì5
- Display (2.4‚Äù TFT): $6‚Äì8
- Battery (1000‚Äì2500 mAh): $3‚Äì5
- PCB & Components: $5‚Äì8
- Enclosure (3D-printed or molded): $2‚Äì4
- **Total:** $20‚Äì30 per unit

### Additional Costs
- Sector Hubs: $10‚Äì15 each
- Server backend: Use of VPS or existing infrastructure
- Development Time: 4‚Äì6 months, 1‚Äì2 developers

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Risks

| Risk Area              | Description                                          | Mitigation Strategy                           |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Hardware Durability    | Devices may degrade in factory environments         | Use rugged cases; design for modular repair   |
| Worker Adoption        | Workers may resist using new devices                | Involve users early in design; training       |
| ESP-NOW Limitations    | ESP-NOW may have limited range or interference      | Deploy overlapping hubs; test coverage zones  |
| Battery Life           | Devices may need frequent recharging                | Use efficient sleep modes and larger batteries|
| Integration with MS Project | Complexity of importing workflows              | Defer until phase 3; use manual steps early   |

## üìà Expected Benefits
- Better scheduling and execution of maintenance routines
- Real-time visibility and accountability
- Reduction in unreported equipment issues
- Scalable architecture for future expansion (e.g., inspections, safety)
